# VR ALIEN HORROR GAME

## Project Overview
This is a bit of a passion project that I've wanted to create for awhile, the goal of this project is to create a game with space physics and a cool interactive AI. Currently I have 1 system implemented for the AI that creates a light detection system using RGB values projected onto a render texture.

## To Do List
1. Create AI system for sight detection, this should be one the easier things to create.
2. Create an Audio Detection system that makes audio created by the user (such as knocking over an object or colliding with a wall) detectable by the enemy.
3. Create a physics system for space interactions, to create a way of traversing in VR that simulates the physics of space, this will include making a localized gravity system for objects in the game to enable the user to move between objects.
